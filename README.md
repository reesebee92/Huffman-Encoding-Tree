# Huffman-Encoding-Tree

The purpose of this project is to make use of the max heap data structure which is 
a special type of priority queue. In order to implement a priority queue a node object
is required. There are 3 java source files included to demonstrate the preorder traversal,
encoding clear text, and decoding encoded text. 

The HuffmanEncodingTree.java file allows a tree to be built given a frequency table
and uses that frequency table to build a tree and store it in the priority queue.
